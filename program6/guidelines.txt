Write a program which allows users to place and read messages on a remote server.
The program should require users to register (i.e., establish a username and password).
Passwords must be stored and compared in an encrypted manner.
Users must sign in prior to using the system.

A user should be able to:

        View a list of other users.
        Request a partnership with another user.
        View partner requests.
        Accept or reject partner requests.
        View a list of partners.
        Send deposit messages for a partner.
        View messages between a partner.
        Messages must be date-time stamped.

Messages may be stored in a fixed length structure; however, they must then be rebuilt into complete messages when displayed.
Multiple users must be able to use the system simultaneously.
Communication between the client and server should be via TCP/IP sockets.
The program must exhibit the features represented by the entirety of the course learning outcomes.
The report must indicate which features are associated with which course learning outcome.
The report must also establish the test environment: a collection of Ubuntu 15.10 VMs within a single hypervisor is the preferred mechanism.
